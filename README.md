# The Algorithmic Panopticon: How AI Amplifies Security Exploits in Online Communities

## Abstract

This research project investigates how Artificial Intelligence acts as a "force multiplier," transforming niche security exploits in online platforms into tools for mass surveillance and manipulation. While modern platforms implement security measures, they harbor inherent vulnerabilities through third-party modifications and features that provide false privacy guarantees, such as ephemeral messaging. Our research explores how AI can automate and scale the harvesting of supposedly private or deleted data, weaponizing it for sophisticated social engineering attacks.

## Problem Statement

The integration of AI fundamentally alters the digital security landscape by:

- **Scaling Exploitation**: AI can systematically exploit platform vulnerabilities that were previously limited to manual, small-scale attacks
- **Automating Data Harvesting**: Converting niche exploits (like Discord client modifications) into mass surveillance tools
- **Weaponizing Privacy Illusions**: Exploiting the "myth of ephemerality" in secure messaging at unprecedented scale

**Core Research Question**: How does the application of AI to existing platform vulnerabilities fundamentally alter the landscape of digital ethics and security?

## Research Methodology

Our team employs a mixed-method approach combining technical investigation, socio-technical analysis, and ethical inquiry across three phases:

### Phase 1: Technical & Systems Analysis
- **Technical Audit**: Investigation of the Vencord plugin ecosystem and security bypass functionalities
- **Data Persistence Analysis**: Documentation of how "deleted" or "ephemeral" content remains recoverable
- **AI System Modeling**: Development of conceptual models for:
  1. AI systems that build psychological profiles from harvested data for social engineering
  2. AI-powered forensic tools for mass reconstruction of ephemeral conversations

### Phase 2: Ethical Framework & Discourse Analysis
- **Ethical Framework Development**: Comprehensive framework based on digital consent, right to be forgotten, and distributive justice
- **Public Discourse Analysis**: Investigation of user motivations and security mental models through platform discussions

### Phase 3: Case Studies
- **Case Study 1**: AI as the Ultimate Phishing Lure - Hyper-personalized attacks using intimate conversation data
- **Case Study 2**: AI, Ephemerality, and Vulnerable Populations - Disproportionate harm to marginalized groups and activists
